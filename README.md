# Database Test Set Manager
Very simple Windows Forms application to manage test data, that is repeatable for test cases.
The data is saved in JSON with formatting, so it's quite easy to merge :)

* Generate output for CSV output and Microsoft SQL
* Export data to different types
  * Text
  * Numbers
  * Guids
  * Date time and offset
  * Time offset only
  * RAW output, so run the SQL as is
* Manage data by different column behaviors
  * DB generation (like identity)
  * Relations between tables
  * Templates powered by Razor
* Assign default values to columns
  * Static value
  * Random from a list
  * C# statement
